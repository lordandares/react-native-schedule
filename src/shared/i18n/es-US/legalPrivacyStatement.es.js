  Who is collecting the information?

These sites may provide additional information, goods, services and/or promotions. These sites are owned and operated independently of TEAM, and have their own separate privacy and data collection practices. Any information you provide to these Web sites will be governed under the terms of their privacy policy, if any. TEAM has no responsibility or liability whatsoever for the independent actions or policies of these independent sites, and is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such sites.

  How is my information used?

  TEAM may collect Personal Information directly from you when you interact with us, such as registering for a service or making an inquiry about purchasing a service from TEAM. We also collect Personal Information relating to transactions you make at our Website when you visit our Website, use our applications, including use (as a TEAM client or client employee) of any TEAM portal or eHub service, or contact us, such as for customer service purposes.
  If you interact with us online, we use cookies and other technological tools to collect information about your computer and your use of our website and applications. We treat this information as Personal Information.
  TEAM’s primary goal in collecting Personal Information is to facilitate business relationships, including providing services to our clients, and to enable us to contact you to fulfill requests. This information may also be used to provide you with a customized experience on our site, which includes interactive communications, and other services.

We use the information you provide to help us design and build better services, to customize your experience, and to provide advice and recommendations. Taking part in any of these segments is always optional.
  We also use the Personal Information we collect to help target valuable marketing and advertising offers. This kind of advertising may be done with banner ads as well as promotional emails sent by TEAM, or by third parties under contract with TEAM.
